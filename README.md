# PS Forge - Automated Algorithm Problem Generator

> Notice: This program is generated by Firebase Studio, via Genkit and NextJS.

> **Actually, the purpose of this project is to test the capabilities of Generative AI. The entire code of this project was generated by AI, except for this README.md file. If you dislike generative AI, but please understand the purpose of this project.** 

> Caution: This program generates problems and solutions using AI, so the quality and correctness of the generated content may vary. Always review and test generated problems before use.


PS Forge is a Next.js application that leverages Generative AI (via Genkit and Google's Gemini model) to automatically generate competitive programming style problem statements, including test case input/output formats, C++ code for input generation, validation, and solutions.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Problem Generation**: Creates unique problem statements based on user-defined criteria.
*   **Configurable Difficulty**: Supports a 1-10 difficulty scale with detailed algorithm expectations per level.
*   **Customizable Inputs**: Allows users to provide algorithm tags, title ideas, problem concepts, and AI temperature.
*   **Automated Code Generation**: Generates C++ code for:
    *   Input generation (using `testlib.h`
    *   Input validation (using `testlib.h`)
    *   Problem solution
*   **Multi-Step Evaluation**:
    *   Initial evaluation of the generated problem statement.
    *   Comprehensive evaluation of the entire problem package (statement, input generator, validator, solution).
*   **Retry Logic**: Includes retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for AI API calls.
*   **Responsive UI**: Built with Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.

## Pre-requisites
*   Node.js (v20 or later)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carotinoid/PS-forge.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd PS-forge
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>" >> .env
    ```
    **Replace `<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>` with your actual Gemini API key.**
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to access the application.

## Building for Production
To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Script Overview
*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server (Turbopack enabled, port 9002).
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server and watches for file changes.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js application for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript compiler for type checking.
